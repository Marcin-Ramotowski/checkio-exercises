# In this mission your task is to determine the popularity of certain words in the text.

This means that if you need to find a word "one" then words like "one", "One", "oNe", "ONE" etc. will do.The search words are always indicated in the lowercase.If the word wasn’t found even once, it has to be returned in the dictionary with  0 (zero) value.Input:The text and the search words array.
#

# 
# Precondition:
# The input text will consists of English letters in uppercase and lowercase and whitespaces.
