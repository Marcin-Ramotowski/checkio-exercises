# Python Programming Exercises Repository
Welcome to my Python programming exercises repository! 
This repository contains a collection of various coding exercises I've completed on the website [Checkio.org](py.checkio.org), 
showcasing my problem-solving skills and proficiency in Python. Below is a brief overview of some of the more intriguing exercises included:

1. Clock Angle - a program that calculates the angle between the hour and minute hands on a clock at any given time.
2. Identify Block - a shape recognition algorithm that identifies specific shapes formed by squares in a grid.
3. Spaceship Landing Strip - An algorithm that identifies a safe landing zone for a spaceship based on terrain data.
4. Radiation Search - a search algorithm that finds the largest contiguous group of identical elements within a grid, simulating a radiation hotspot.
5. Safe Coasts - a map analysis program that determines a safe zone on a map where threats (e.g., the Flying Dutchman) cannot reach.
6. Stair Steps - an optimization problem that finds the best path to maximize the score while climbing a staircase.
7. Find Sequence - a sequence detection algorithm that identifies repeating number sequences in a list.
8. Inside Block - a geometric algorithm to determine whether a point is inside a given polygon.
9. Earth Distances - a program that calculates the distance between two points on the Earth's surface using the Haversine formula.
10. Calculate Islands - an island detection algorithm that identifies islands on a map and calculates their area.
11. Golden Pyramid - an optimization problem that finds the highest scoring path through a pyramid of numbers.
12. Network Attack - a program which simulates the spread of a virus across a computer network.
13. The Cheapest Flight - an algorithm to find the cheapest flight route between cities, using graph traversal techniques.
14. Open Labyrinth - a pathfinding algorithm that finds the exit in a labyrinth.
15. Shooting Range - a collision detection program that counts the points scored when shooting targets.
16. Pattern Recognition - a pattern-matching algorithm that searches for a specific pattern within a matrix.
17. Mono Captcha - a program for recognizing patterns in slightly distorted matrices, simulating a CAPTCHA solver.

Exercises are grouped into directories corresponding to the islands in which they are located in the game.
You will find here all exercises which are available in the game. In each file is problem description and if I have resolved problem you will find also my own solution.
In the Checkio Portal are about 500 missions. So far I have resolved 282 of them. New ones are still being added.
