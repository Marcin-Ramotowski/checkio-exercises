#!/usr/bin/env checkio --domain=py run text-formatting

# You are given a long line (a monospace font), and you have to break the line in order to respect a given width.	Then you have to format the text according to the given style: 'l' means you have to align the text to theleft, 'c' forcenter, 'r' forright, and 'j' means you have tojustify the text.	Finally, the lines of the output shouldnâ€™t end with a whitespace.
# 
# If you have to put 2 * n + 1 spaces around a line in order to center it, then put n spaces before, not n + 1.
# 
# The justification rules:Since we can't always put the same number of spaces between words in a line, put big blocks of spaces first. For example: X---X---X--X--X--X when you have to put 12 spaces in 5 gaps: 3-3-2-2-2.Don't justify the last line of a text.
# 
# You won't have to consider splitting a word into two parts because the given widths are big enough.
# 
# Input:A text (string), width (integer) and style (string).
# 
# Output:The formatted text (string).
# 
# Preconditions:all(len(word) <= width for word in text.split())'\n' not in textstyle in ('l', 'c', 'r', 'j')0 < len(text) <= 1000
