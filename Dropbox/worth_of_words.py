#!/usr/bin/env checkio --domain=py run worth-of-words

# Hey, are you ready for a Scrabble game party?
# You have a list of words and you have to find only one that is the most valuable among  them.
# Rules:
# The worth of each word is equivalent to the sum of letters which it consists of.
# The values of the letters are as follow:
# e, a, i, o, n, r, t, l, s, u = 1
# d, g = 2
# b, c, m, p = 3
# f, h, v, w, y = 4
# k = 5
# j, x = 8
# q, z = 10
# For example, the worth of the word 'dog' is 5, because 'd' = 2, 'o' = 1 and 'g' = 2.
# 
# 
# 
# Input:A list of words.
# 
# Output:The most valuable word.
# 
# Precondition:
# 2 <= words <= 10
# Real words only
# lowercase letters only
# 
# 
# END_DESC
