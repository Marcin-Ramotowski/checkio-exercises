# There is a standard 6-sided ðŸŽ², which looks and placed as shown below. It may be rolled in four cardinal directions:North,South,West,East.

# 
# For the mission you are given a stringmoveswith directions. You need to find out, what side of ðŸŽ² is on top after rolling.
# 
# Input:String with directions of rolling.
# 
# Output:Number of side, which is on top.
# 
# Examples:
# 
# assert rolling_dice("SN") == 1
# assert rolling_dice("") == 1
# assert rolling_dice("EESWN") == 6
# assert rolling_dice("NWSNWEESNW") == 3
# The mission was taken fromAIZU ONLINE JUDGE (ITP1_11_A: Dice I).
