In this mission we will    realize a data structure which we will use to store and work with a friend network.
# 
# The class "Friends" should contains names and the connections between them. Names are    represented as strings and are case sensitive. Connections are undirected, so if "sophia" is    connected with "nikola", then it's also correct in reverse.
# 
# classFriends(connections)
# 
# Returns a new Friends instance."connections"is an iterable of sets with two elements    in each. Each connection contains two names as strings. Connections can be repeated in the    initial data, but inside it's stored once. Each connection has only two states - existing or not.
# 
# 
# >>> Friends(({"a", "b"}, {"b", "c"}, {"c", "a"}, {"a", "c"}))
# >>> Friends([{"1", "2"}, {"3", "1"}])
# 
# add(connection)
# 
# Add a connection in the instance."connection"is a set of two names (strings).    Returns True if this connection is new.    Returns False if this connection exists already.
# 
# 
# >>> f = Friends([{"1", "2"}, {"3", "1"}])
# >>> f.add({"1", "3"})
# False
# >>> f.add({"4", "5"})
# True
# 
# remove(connection)
# 
# Remove a connection from the instance."connection"is a set of two names (strings).    Returns True if this connection exists.    Returns False if this connection is not in the instance.
# 
# 
# >>> f = Friends([{"1", "2"}, {"3", "1"}])
# >>> f.remove({"1", "3"})
# True
# >>> f.remove({"4", "5"})
# False
# 
# names()
# 
# Returns a set of names. The set contains only names which are connected with somebody.
# 
# 
# >>> f = Friends(({"a", "b"}, {"b", "c"}, {"c", "d"}))
# >>> f.names()
# {"a", "b", "c", "d"}
# >>> f.remove({"d", "c"})
# True
# >>> f.names()
# {"a", "b", "c"}
# 
# connected(name)
# 
# Returns a set of names which is connected with the given"name".    If "name" does not exist in the instance, then return an empty set.
# 
# 
# >>> f = Friends(({"a", "b"}, {"b", "c"}, {"c", "a"}))
# >>> f.connected("a")
# {"b", "c"}
