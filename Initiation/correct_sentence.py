# For the input of your function, you will be given one sentence. You have to return a corrected version, that starts with a capital letter and ends with a period (dot).
# 
# Pay attention to the fact that not all of the fixes are necessary. If a sentence already ends with a period (dot), then adding another one will be a mistake.

# Input:A string.

# Output:A string.
# 
# Precondition:No leading and trailing spaces, text contains only spaces, a-z A-Z , and .
