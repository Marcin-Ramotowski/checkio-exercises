# Tic-Tac-Toe, sometimes also known as Xs and Os, is a game for two players (X and O) who take    turns marking spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their respective    marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row (NW-SE and NE-SW) wins the game. Maybe you've    solve"Xs and Os Referee"already and this mission will be simpler for you.
# 
# In this mission, you will play against various bots, your goal is to never lose. You may only    achieve wins or draws. For each game your function is called several times (in the same    environment) for each move until the game is over.
# 
# For each step your function receives a grid state as a sequence of strings, where "X" is a    X-mark, "O" is an O-mark and "." is an empty cell. The second argument is for your mark, either    "X" or "O". For each move your function should return the coordinates of the your next mark as a    sequence of two numbers - row and column. Rows and columns are numbered starting from zero.
# 
# Input:Two arguments. A grid state as a tuple of strings (unicode) and    your mark as a string "X" or "O".
# 
# Output:The coordinates of your move as a list or a tuple of two integers from    0 to 2.
# 
# 
# Precondition:
# len(grid) == 3
# all(all(ch in "XO." for ch in row) and len(row) == 3 for row in grid)
#
